## Moderation

#### Tip topics only get rejected when they are considered detrimental to the stream or blatantly breach YouTube TOS

Please avoid making topics about the following things to prevent your topic from being rejected:

- Instructions on how to carry out terrorism or violent extremism
    - eg. "Peter explains the best places and methods to set up homemade pipe
      bombs to inflict maximum civilian damage in government buildings"
- Excessive N-word spam to get the stream banned
    - eg. "Carter says Digger 100 times but replaces the letter D with the letter N"
- Particularly vulgar and explicit pedophilia with clearly little to no attempt at comedy/satire
    - Examples of topics that would not be accepted:
        - "Herbert tells a story about the time he had sex with a 13 year old in graphic detail"
        - "Herbert explains to the audience where they should go on the internet to download child porn"
    - Examples of topics that are accepted:
        - "Herbert argues why it's not fair that he's not allowed near schools anymore"
        - "Herbert fucks Chris"
- Malicious impersonation and defamation of other users
    - This is dealt with on a case-by-case basis
    - These will usually be accepted provided they are within the realms of satirical interpretation
- Doxxing and personal threats
    - eg. "Peter tells the audience to call the phone number 555-420-6969 and tell them they know they live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico"
    - clearly fake information is allowed, but be wary as the mods may not realize that it's fake
