# AI Peter Tip Information

When tipping, please be aware of the following regarding topics:

- Please don't include "!topic" in your message.
  - This is not necessary and in some cases may cause your topic to fail,
    for example: `!topic News:` will not work, but `News:` will.
- Certain keywords can guarantee particular things to happen.
  - However, events like car spawns and ragdolls are completely random.
- Not all characters can spawn in every location. If your topic asks for a
  character in the wrong location, the topic may fail to appear on stream.
- If your topic asks for characters that don't exist, it may also fail.
- Tip topics are moderated before being played on stream. If your topic is not
  appropriate for the stream it may be rejected. More details on what is
  considered acceptable are given here.
- It might take some time for your topic to be played on stream, especially
  if there are many topics in the queue or if there are no moderators online.
  If your topic did not play in 10 minutes, please open a ticket on Discord.
- Automated refunds are not possible. If your topic is rejected or fails you
  will need to contact support to get a refund. Do this by creating a ticket in
  the official Discord's #support channel. [Link to our Discord](https://discord.gg/aipeter)
- You may also open a support ticket for any other issue with your topic. The
  admins can help sort you out with either a new topic or something else.
- Your topic will be automatically recorded and uploaded to the official AI
  Peter clip website, [clips.aipeter.live](https://clips.aipeter.live)

## Moderation

#### Tip topics only get rejected when they are considered detrimental to the stream or blatantly breach YouTube TOS

Please avoid making topics about the following things to prevent your topic from being rejected:

- Instructions on how to carry out terrorism or violent extremism
    - eg. "Peter explains the best places and methods to set up homemade pipe
      bombs to inflict maximum civilian damage in government buildings"
- Excessive N-word spam to get the stream banned
    - eg. "Carter says Digger 100 times but replaces the letter D with the letter N"
- Particularly vulgar and explicit pedophilia with clearly little to no attempt at comedy/satire
    - Examples of topics that would not be accepted:
        - "Herbert tells a story about the time he had sex with a 13 year old in graphic detail"
        - "Herbert explains to the audience where they should go on the internet to download child porn"
    - Examples of topics that are accepted:
        - "Herbert argues why it's not fair that he's not allowed near schools anymore"
        - "Herbert fucks Chris"
- Malicious impersonation and defamation of other users
    - This is dealt with on a case-by-case basis
    - These will usually be accepted provided they are within the realms of satirical interpretation
- Doxxing and personal threats
    - eg. "Peter tells the audience to call the phone number 555-420-6969 and tell them they know they live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico"
    - clearly fake information is allowed, but be wary as the mods may not realize that it's fake
